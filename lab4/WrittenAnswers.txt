a) The 'j' variable should be private because each thread needs to do 1->j iterations on its value of 'i'.

b) Each loop must keep track of its own number of equal values, and then use a reduction to sum them all at the end.

c) Yes we can. Simply put the call to memcpy in a for loop(copy each array index instead of the block of memory) and
then use the OMP parallel for to call it.

d) See included code

e) Our parallel implementation is far faster than the serial, about 6x, but qsort is even faster than the parallel, about 32x faster.
